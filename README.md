# NUDL
A simple implementation of the NUDL design system in pure CSS. Since [the original Svelte implementation](https://github.com/negative-zero-inft/real-nudl) was never done, and [NRD](https://github.com/NRDsstuff) doesn't want to publish the Figma files for whatever reasons like he used to do, I made a simple implementation of the Negative zero Unified Design Language in pure CSS.

This is old source code I found on my machine and wanted to upload. I might update it if I get bored, who knows?

Credits to [NRD](https://github.com/NRDsstuff) as the original author of the design system, icons & wallpaers used on this repo.
